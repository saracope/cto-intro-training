# Intro training path for CTO intern/ELP/Pathways staff

## Getting Started
Start working through the list below:
* Review the [GSA GitHub policy](https://github.com/GSA/GitHub-Administration). Create/update your GitHub account, following these instructions.
* Review the tech talk on [version control](https://saracope.github.io/github-techtalk/#/).
* Enter a ServiceNow ticket to have the following software added to your GFE (if needed):
  * Ruby
  * Node
  * GitHub Desktop
  * Sublime Text 3
* Start the [HTML & CSS intro course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html-css) on Codecademy (free).
* Do the [GitHub 101 training](https://services.github.com/on-demand/) online.

Some additional suggestions:  
* Keep a running list of questions so that we can be sure to cover those when we get together.
* Keep a work log or journal to track the things you do. At the end of each day or throughout your day, jot down the things you learned or worked on. This doesn't have to be extensive, just enough to keep track. This will help with your check-in meetings and also with your resume/job search/interviews later on.
* Feel free to IM/email me between sessions if you get stuck somewhere or need more things to work on. 
* Try to get coffee/lunch/hangout with someone around the office once a week, even if it's on a different team and also go to local meetups if you have the time. It's good to get out there and meet people and build your network. You'll find that most jobs/opportunities come from people you've met and not from cold job applications to a company.

Other resources to start familiarizing yourself with:
* Trello
* Slack
* Federalist

When you are ready, start creating Jira cards for the training you are working on.
